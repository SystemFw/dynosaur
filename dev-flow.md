# Developer flow

## Local docs

Docs are based on:

- `docsify`, a _dynamic_ , markdown based generator.
- `mdoc`, typechecked scala/markdown compiler

The source for the docs is in `yourProject/docs`, the website in
`yourProject/target/website`. The currently deployed website is in the
`gh-pages` branch.

To preview the site locally, you need to install:

```
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

then, start mdoc in an sbt session:

```
sbt docs/mdoc --watch
```

and docsify in a shell session:

```
cd yourProject/target/website
docsify serve .
```

and you'll get an updating preview.
Note that `mdoc` watches the markdown files, so if you change the code
itself it will need a manual recompile.

`docsify` uses 3 special files: `index.html`, `_coverpage.md`, `_sidebar.md`,
the sidebar needs to have a specific format:

- newlines in between headers
- and no extra modifiers inside links `[good]`, `[**bad**]` (or collapse will not work)

## Release

Push a `vx.y.z` tag on `main` to release. It will fail if semver isn't
respected wrt bincompat.
Docs are released automatically on each code release, if you need a
docs-only deploy, (force) push `main` to the `docs-deploy` branch.

To change/add branches to release:

> ThisBuild / spiewakMainBranches := Seq("main", "develop")

To relax semver:

> ThisBuild / strictSemVer := false

To publish snapshot on every main build:

> ThisBuild / spiewakCiReleaseSnapshots := true

Caveat:
If you are publishing snapshots, you need to make sure that new
commits are fully built before you push a proper release tag: push
`main`, wait for the snapshot release to complete, and then push the
tag.

## Initial setup

These steps only need to be done once when setting up the repo.

- Make sure the default branch is named `main`
- Generate ci definitions with `sbt githubWorkflowGenerate` and commit the results.
- Create and push a `gh-pages` branch. Enable Github Pages on that branch

Then, configure the following encrypted secrets within GitHub Actions:

- SONATYPE_USERNAME
- SONATYPE_PASSWORD
- PGP_SECRET

Once you know the value for a secret, it can be created by going to

> Your repo -> settings -> left sidebar -> Secrets -> new repository secret.

populate sonatype user and password with a user token:

- login to https://oss.sonatype.org,
- click your username in the top right, then profiles,
- in the tab that was opened, click on the top left dropdown, and select "User Token",
- click "Access User Token", and you'll get the name and password parts of the token

populate pgp_secret with a new per project key. This assumes you have
`gpg` and a personal key already setup.

Generate a new key with `gpg --gen-key`

- Use `yourProject bot` as name
- Use your email address as email
- Leave the passphrase empty: we need to export the key with no
  passphrase since it will be encrypted by github actions. Only use
  this key for this project, don't use your personal key

You can `gpg --list-secret-keys` to view the id of the key you have generated.

Now export the key

> gpg --export-secret-keys yourKeyId | base64 | pbcopy

and paste it the PGP_SECRET Github Secret.

Then sign the new project key with your personal key:

> gpg --sign-key yourKeyId

and publish it to a keyserver

> gpg --keyserver http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/ --send-key yourKeyId
